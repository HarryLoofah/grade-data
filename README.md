grade-data
==========

A script for processing ELD grades from .csv files. This script does not focus
on individual student progress, but plots overall classroom trends.

The program reads a previously downloaded gradebook spreadsheet then converts
'number +/-' scores, standards based scores, and 'missing' or 'excused' values
to numeric values. Afterwards, scores will be processed so that growth data can
be observed via plotting. Also, program assumes input is .csv since this is the
only file download format available.
