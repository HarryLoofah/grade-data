grade-data
==========

A script for processing ELD grades from .csv files.  This script does not focus
on individual student progress, but plots overall classroom trends.

The program reads a previously downloaded gradebook spreadsheet then converts
'number +/-' scores and standards based scores to numeric values, and handles
'missing' or 'excused' values.  Afterwards, scores will be processed so that
growth data can be observed via plotting.  Program assumes input is .csv.
